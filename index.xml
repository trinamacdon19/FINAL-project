Fish species commonly raised may include tilapia, catfish, or trout, depending on the local demand and market conditions.

Agroforestry is integrated into the farm's operations, with the cultivation of trees and other woody plants alongside agricultural crops and livestock. This approach promotes biodiversity, improves soil health, and provides additional income streams through the sale of timber and non-timber forest products.
