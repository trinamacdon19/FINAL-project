				<h3>Buenavista was formerly called Sabang. A certain rich man named Don Cornelio Sadiua settled in the place and popularized the name “Buenavista” which means good view. On November 9, 1918, the municipality of Buenavista was formally organized1. The town started as early as 1581 whenA a small settlement governed by Spaniards led by Gonzalo de Peñalosa was constructed atop the hilly area of Barangay Old Poblacion overlooking the Guimaras Strait2. In 1945, the combined U.S. and Allied Philippine Commonwealth military forces landed at Caigangan beach in Buenavista and attacked from the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Marinduque. The Buenavista Campaign was the first major offensive fought during the Battle of Marinduque.
